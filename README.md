# Polymorph-Shellcode-Generator

This project generates shellcode based on a provided IP and port, compiles a C program to execute the shellcode, and runs the compiled binary.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Colorama (Python package)

## Installation

1. **Install GCC**:
   - On Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install gcc
     ```
   - On Red Hat-based systems (like CentOS):
     ```bash
     sudo yum install gcc
     ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   - Install requirements using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Download the JSON Files**:
   - Ensure you have `socket_creation_steps.json` and `connection_steps.json` in the same directory as the Python script.

## Usage

1. **Generate and Execute Shellcode**:
   - Run the Python script with the desired IP and port as arguments.
     ```bash
     python generator.py <IP> <PORT>
     ```
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python generator.py 192.168.1.100 4444
     ```

## Files

- `generator.py`: Python script that generates shellcode, compiles a C program, and executes the shellcode.
- `shellcode.c`: C program generated by the Python script (dynamically created).
- `socket_creation_steps.json`: JSON file containing socket creation steps.
- `connection_steps.json`: JSON file containing connection steps.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the generator:

1. **Run the Python Script**:
   ```bash
   python generator.py 192.168.1.100 4444
    ```
